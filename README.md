# READ ALL ABOUT IT!
a simple web app for organizing digital news

### Introduction
This was my first project working in the React framework. It was also my first project in Mod3 at Turing School of Software & Design. I was given four days to build this app out completely. It is a web app for organizing/finding news articles. The project also includes a testing suite using Jest and Enzyme to test the React files.

### How it works
The app displays news articles from five different categories (local, entertainment, technology, science, health). Upon page load, the local news (Denver, CO) is displayed. The user may choose one of the five news category headings on the left navigation bar to see the subsequent news articles displayed to the right. Each article displayed on the page includes an image, headline, description, and link to the full page article. There is a non-case sensitive search bar at the top of the page which allows the user to search within the selected news category for any words contained in the headline or description of an article. The user will see an error message displayed if their search did not fruit any results.
